# Launch the project

## Prerequisites

### **What we need ?**
For this project you will need to have **Python3(version 11)** installed on your computer. If it's not already done, you can find the installation [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### **How to build** :

First way: (Using Virtual Environment)

    You have to configure an environment. Then let's create a virtual environment:
```sh
        python3 -m venv .venv
```

    Once your virtual env is created, you can install the required packages provide by the requirements.txt file:
```sh
        .venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Second way: (Without Virtual Environment)

    Let's install the required packages provide by the requirements.txt file:
```sh
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


You can now launch the project throught the notebooks using an IDE.
